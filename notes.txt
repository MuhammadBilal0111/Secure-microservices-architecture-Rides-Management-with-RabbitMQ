Request Flow:
1. Request Hits Gateway
  You send a request to:
  http://localhost:3000/user/register

2. Gateway Routing
The gateway (:3000) sees the /user prefix and forwards the entire request to:
http://localhost:3001/register
(Note: The /user prefix is stripped during forwarding)

3. User Service Processing
Your User Service (:3001) receives the request at its /register endpoint and processes it normally.

we are communication from ride service to user service and fetching the data with the help of specific route. This type of communication is called synchronous communication.
Advantage: Immediately fetch data
but ride service depend upon the user service here is the negative point user service down ride service downs

RabbitMq - a message broker that is used to connect multiple services for asynchronous communication
all services are independent but there is a lil sync (thora sync me rakhna pare ga)
Now all the three micrservices connecttion must be estalished with message broker
whenever a ride created it will generate the message to "message "broker" and tells that one ride has been made, now the message broker tell about the rides creation to the captain to accept or not.

RabbitMq -> primarily works on queue system.
there is a queue of ride creation where only the ride creation data must be saved
if captain accept the ride, this data must be saved in other queue
RabbitMq -> used for asynchronous communication
advantage: if captain service down then th ride service can easily works
disadvatage: response delay because of asynchronous behaviour
use library amqp lib

use for asynchronous communication between microservices
